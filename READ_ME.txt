With Spyder or any IDE:

Open the KNN.py program in spyder or any IDE and click run on the tool bar.

For different K values Please change the K value that is mention in the program.

Two methods are there:
1)getWeightedAccuracy()    -> weighted implementation
2)getUnweightedAccuracy()  -> unweighted implementation

Please comment either one to get the necessary output

Without Spyder or IDE:

Pass the path of the program as an argument to the Python interpreter. Such as follows:

Example:--->

C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Users\Username\Desktop\KNN.py

Note that you must use the full path of the Python interpreter.

If you want to simply type python.exe C:\Users\Username\Desktop\my_python_script.py you must add python.exe to your PATH environmental variable.
